This was a simple project made to display different images each time either button was hit.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I started with making 3 reels in html to hold the results of the random values. I created 2 buttons for the bet amount and a space to hold the total amount of money. Then in JavaScript I made it so it put the random values in the reels and then update the total amount depending on if you won or lost.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that you can make it so JavaScript picks a random value and then show that value in html.
